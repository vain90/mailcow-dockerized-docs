In Docker the containerized application (PID 1) writes its output to stdout. For real one-application containers this works just fine. Run docker-compose logs --help to learn more. Some containers log or stream to multiple destinations. No container will keep persistent logs in it. Containers are transient items! In the end, every line of logs will reach the Docker daemon - unfiltered. The default logging driver is \"json\" . Filtered logs Some logs are filtered and written to Redis keys but also streamed to a Redis channel. The Redis channel is used to stream logs with failed authentication attempts to be read by netfilter-mailcow. The Redis keys are persistent and will keep 10000 lines of logs for the web UI. This mechanism makes it possible to use whatever Docker logging driver you want to, without losing the ability to read logs from the UI or ban suspicious clients with netfilter-mailcow. Redis keys will only hold logs from applications and filter out system messages (think of cron etc.). Logging drivers Here is the good news: Since Docker has some great logging drivers, you can integrate mailcow: dockerized into your existing logging environment with ease. Docker logging drivers can now be implemented as plugins, next to Dockers integrated drivers. Logging driver plugins are available in Docker 17.05 and higher.

Make sure you change HTTP_BIND and HTTPS_BIND in mailcow.conf to a local address and set the ports accordingly, for example: HTTP_BIND = 127 .0.0.1 HTTP_PORT = 8080 HTTPS_BIND = 127 .0.0.1 HTTPS_PORT = 8443 IMPORTANT: Do not use port 8081! Recreate affected containers by running docker-compose up -d . Warning Make sure you run generate_config.sh before you enable any site configuration examples below. The script generate_config.sh copies snake-oil certificates to the correct location, so the services will not fail to start due to missing files. Info Using the site configs below will forward ACME requests to mailcow and let it handle certificates itself. The downside of using mailcow as ACME client behind a reverse proxy is, that you will need to reload your webserver after acme-mailcow changed/renewed/created the certificate. You can either reload your webserver daily or write a script to watch the file for changes. On many servers logrotate will reload the webserver daily anyway. If you want to use a local certbot installation, you will need to change the SSL certificate parameters accordingly. Make sure you run a post-hook script when you decide to use external ACME clients. You will find an example at the bottom of this page. 2. Configure your local webserver as reverse proxy: Apache 2.4 Required modules: a2enmod rewrite proxy proxy_http headers ssl We rewrite to HTTPS, but keep requests to autoconfig.* on a plain session.

Both U2F and Yubi OTP work well with the fantastic Yubikey . While Yubi OTP needs an active internet connection and an API ID + key, U2F will work with any FIDO U2F USB key out of the box, but can only be used when mailcow is accessed over HTTPS. U2F and Yubi OTP support multiple keys per user. As the third TFA method mailcow uses TOTP: time-based one-time passwords. Those passwords can be generated with apps like \"Google Authenticator\" after initially scanning a QR code or entering the given secret manually. As administrator you are able to temporary disable a domain administrators TFA login until they successfully logged in. The key used to login will be displayed in green, while other keys remain grey. Yubi OTP The Yubi API ID and Key will be checked against the Yubico Cloud API. When setting up TFA you will be asked for your personal API account for this key. The API ID, API key and the first 12 characters (your YubiKeys ID in modhex) are stored in the MySQL table as secret.
